# Version Control Code-Of-Conduct

Our group is dedicated to providing the community with a harrassment-free and simple coding experience. There is a zero-tolerancy policy for any kind of disrespecful code. This includes but is not limited to the use of slurs, harrassment of any kind, or bullying of others. Violation of this policy will result in the permanent expulsion of the environment. 

Users can build on the sample code in any way they want, as long as they don't breach the behavior policy. Upon accepting the code of conduct, the user will await approval from a current contributer to the respository. If the user is approved, they will be able to make changes to any code. See the README file for an email to contact once applying. Requests will be processed in a timely manor - 3 to 5 business days.
